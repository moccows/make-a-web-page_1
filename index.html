<div id="stage0"><h2>Stage 0: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
      <div id="stage01"><h3>How Internet Works<br></h3>
      <p>I pay my cable bill, that's how. (my sense of humor is lame)<br>Browser on my computer connects to the Internet (if I paid my cable bill) by typing the URL of a website, which in turn connects to a server using HTTP protocol. Server finds the appropriate HTML doc and sends it back to my computer.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage02"><h3>HTML basics</h3>
      <p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. Markups are tags. E.g., "b" tag makes text <b>bold</b>, and "em" is for <em>italics</em>. Void tags are tags that don't require a closing tag (that's the one with a "/" at the end of a piece of text that you want to apply your tag to).</p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage03"><h3>Whitespace</h3>
      <p>Two types of tags are <i>inline</i> and <i>block</i> tags. Unlike inline tags, block tags (e.g. "p" tag I'm using for this very paragraph) actually create a box around the text they are applied to.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage04"><h3>Computers are Stupid</h3>
      <img src="http://www.bristollib.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sad-Keyboard.jpg" alt="koala ate this picture">
      <div class="image_description">I just called a computer stupid, and now this button is sad. Sorry, computer!</div> 
      <p>Anyway, computers are stupid because we have to tell them <em>exactly</em> what to do. It won't understand you if you made a syntax error. <br> Always check your work! (if you are still not sure, ask a human for help)</p>      
</div>
<div id="stage1"><h2>Stage 1: Webpages, Documents, and Structure</h2>
      <div id="stage11"><h3>HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</h3>
      <p>HTML represents the <em>structure</em> of a webpage, JavaScript is for <em>interactive components</em>, and CSS adds <em>styles</em>.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage12"><h3>DOM (Document Object Model)</h3>
      <p>DOM is a tree-like stucture of a page, where every tag is an element in a tree.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage13"><h3>Everything is a Box!</h3>
      <p>It's useful to start looking at every webpage from the perspective of "seeing boxes". E.g., every header on this very page is a box, every text paragraph is a a box, etc. If I had pasted an image here, it would be its' own box, too.<br> Actually, let me do it.</p>
      <img src="http://whsjohnnygreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/koala3.jpg" alt="koala ate this picture">
      <div class="image_description">Here is a picture of a koala (you're welcome). And yes, it's also a box.</div></div>
      </div>
      <div id="stage14"><h3>CSS</h3>
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The most important rule we should remember is <b>inheritance rule: the most specific rule is applied to <u>every</u> element.</b><br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">Here is a link</a> if you need to reference any CSS property.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage15"><h3>Don't Repeat Yourself!</h3>
      <p>Avoiding repetition is one of the most important ideas in programming. CSS is very helpful with that.
      <br>If you repeat yourself while writing code, you are:</p>
      <ul><li>more prone to mistakes (which are harder to fix since it will take more time to located the error source), and
          <li>less consistent (by working from general to specific, you will be able to maintain a consistent style)
      </ul>
      <p>So think about different <em>classes</em> you can organize the elements on your page into, and then apply a certain style (when needed) to the whole class, instead of each element separately.      </p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage16"><h3>The Box Model (and how to make lists!)</h3>
      <p>Every box consists of the following elements:</p>
      <ul><li> Margin (clears the area around the border)<br>
      <li>Border<br>
      <li>Padding (clears the area around the content)<br>
      <li>Content (nucleus of the box; like this text inside it's "paragraph" box)</ul>
      <p>Also, I just accidentally learned <b>how to make lists:</b> you need a "ul" ("ol" for numbers) tag and an "li" (void) tag for every bullet/number. I'm happy I know how to do it now - I basically think in bullet points!
      Here is a link for more details/options: <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/getting_started/article.php/3479461">how to make lists.</a></p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage17"><h3>Flexbox</h3>
      <p>If you would like to make a box flexible (for better alignment of elements on a page), you need to add "display: flex" in the CSS code. For example, I used flexbox for my table of contents to make it look slightly more interesting (took a while...).<br>A useful guide for all things flex can be found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox">here</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="stage18"><h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3>  
      <p>This is a routine we all should follow while designing a page:</p>
      <ol><li>Look for natural boxes.
      <li>Look for repeates styles and semantic elements.
      <li>Write HTML.
      <li>Apply styles (from biggest to smallest).
      <li>Fix things.</ol>
      <p>And here are links you can go to when you need to validate your code:
